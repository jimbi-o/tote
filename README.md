# tote

Tote is a brief, lightweight C++ library for containers such as resizable arrays and hash maps.

It is greatly inspired by [The Defold engine code style](https://defold.com/2020/05/31/The-Defold-engine-code-style/) and their container implementations ([array](https://github.com/defold/defold/blob/dev/engine/dlib/src/dmsdk/dlib/array.h), [hashtable](https://github.com/defold/defold/blob/dev/engine/dlib/src/dlib/hashtable.h)).
